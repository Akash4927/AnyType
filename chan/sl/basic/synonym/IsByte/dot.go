/* Quote from "The Go Programming Language" Chapter 3 - page 52:
The type rune is a synonym for int32 and conventionally indicates that a value is a Unicode code point. The two names may be used interchangeably.

Similarly, the type byte is a synonym for uint8, and emphasizes that the value is a piece of raw data rather than a small numeric quantity.

Finally, there is an unsigned integer type uintptr, whose width is not specified but is sufficient to hold all the bits of a pointer value.
The uintptr type is used only for low-level programming, such as at the boundary of a Go program with a C library or an operating system.
