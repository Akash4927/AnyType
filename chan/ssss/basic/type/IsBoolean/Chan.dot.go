// MakeChan returns a new open channel
// (simply a 'chan bool' that is).
//
// Note: No '-producer' is launched here yet! (as is in all the other functions).
//
// This is useful to easily create corresponding variables such as
//
//	var myPipelineStartsHere := MakeChan()
//	// ... lot's of code to design and build Your favourite "myWorkflowPipeline"
//	// ...
//	// ... *before* You start pouring data into it, e.g. simply via:
//	for drop := range water {
//		myPipelineStartsHere <- drop
//	}
//	close(myPipelineStartsHere)
//
// Hint: especially helpful, if Your piping library operates on some hidden (non-exported) type
// (or on a type imported from elsewhere - and You don't want/need or should(!) have to care.)
//
// Note: as always (except for PipeBuffer) the channel is unbuffered.
